## Card Creation Guide

### Tools Required

- Figma
- Blender (with csgoitem.blend)
- Image editing software for upscaling

### Card Creation Process

1. **Blender Setup**

   - Use csgoitem.blend to render your weapon images
   - weapons are exported with Source2Viewer as a gltf then imported into blender where it is manually lit and exported at high quality

2. **Figma Layout**

   ![screenshot](<dev/Screenshot 2025-02-13 173930.png>)

   - Create an outer frame of 450x630 pixels
   - Inside this, create Frame 1 at 300x420 pixels
   - Place your rendered weapon image inside the outer frame

3. **Image Export Process**
   1. Export Frame 1 (300x420)
   2. Upscale the exported image by 4x to achieve 1200x1680 final resolution
   3. This will be your final card image

### Card Design Specifications

- **Outer Frame**: Ax630 pixels

  - Used as the working area in Figma
  - Contains all design elements
  - A can be anything, as long as the inner frame is centered

- **Inner Frame (Frame 1)**: 300x420 pixels
  - Main card design area
  - Will be upscaled 4x for final output

### Adding New Cards
